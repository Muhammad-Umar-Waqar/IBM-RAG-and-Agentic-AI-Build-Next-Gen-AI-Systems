# 🤖 IBM RAG and Agentic AI — Build Next-Gen AI Systems  

Welcome to my learning repository for the **IBM RAG and Agentic AI: Build Next-Gen AI Systems** course offered by **IBM on Coursera**.  
This repository contains all my **notes, PDFs, insights, and topic-wise resources** that I gathered while completing the course.  

---

## 🧠 About the Course  
The **IBM RAG and Agentic AI** course explores how **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** and **Agentic AI** empower large language models (LLMs) to build more **reliable, context-aware, and intelligent AI systems**.  

Throughout the course, I learned how to:
- Integrate **retrieval systems** with LLMs for more accurate and updated responses.  
- Design and implement **agentic workflows** for autonomous decision-making.  
- Apply **RAG pipelines** to real-world problems using IBM’s AI tools and frameworks.
